Comments from the Developer(s)
==============================

Macchiato is our personal labor of love. Anything that we have ever found
ourselves writing over, and over, and over again will eventually make it into
this library. The code that gets checked-in here is indispensable to almost
every significant new JavaScript project that we work on, and hopefully others
find it to be as useful as we have found it to be. <development@neuroxy.com>

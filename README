Comments from the Developer(s)
==============================

Macchiato is our personal labor of love. Anything that we have ever found
ourselves writing over, and over, and over again will eventually make it into
this library. The classes that get checked-in are indispensable to almost every
significant new JavaScript project that we work on, and hopefully others find
find them to be as useful as we have found them to be. <software@neuroxy.com>

Macchiato
=========
Building the Macchiato Library
------------------------------

If you have Node.js and CoffeeScript installed, chances are you have Cake - the
CoffeeScript build tool. If so, you should be able to run:

	# Change into the base Macchiato project directory
	cd /somewhere/on/your/disk/Macchiato
	# Use the Cake utility to build the project
	cake build

Cake should display some text on the screen that looks something like:

	Macchiato - The CoffeeScript toolkit.
	Building the complete Macchiato library...
	Done.

The finished library file will be inside of the Macchiato/JavaScript directory,
and should be named "Macchiato.js".

Comments from the Developer(s)
------------------------------
Macchiato is a personal labor of love. Anything that I have ever found myself
writing over, and over, and over again will eventually make it into this
library. The code that gets checked-in here is indispensable to almost every
significant new JavaScript project that I work on, and hopefully others find it
as useful as I have found it to be. <sheatrevor>

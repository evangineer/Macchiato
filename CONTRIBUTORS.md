What differentiates a successful project from an unsuccessful one is clear
communication, and that's exactly what this Wiki is for. If someone pointed you
to one of these pages, it's not because they are attacking you or beating your
contributions down (usually.) It's because everyone really does want your
contributions to be included in this project!

So, before doing anything else, please take a few minutes to get familiar with
these guidelines. If you find yourself confused by something that is written
here, feel free to ask questions about it. Or, if you know how to make the
information better, change it. This is a Wiki, after all.
